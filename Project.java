/** 
 * https://bit.ly/nrg-java-training
 * 
 * Create a Student class with fields:
 * int age
 * int class (9 - 12)
 * String favoriteSubject
 * double gpa (0 - 4)
 * boolean canGraduate
 * double happiness
 * 
 * And also keep track of the total number of students
 * 
 * Create a constructor that takes favoriteSubject, and gpa
 * Create setters and getters for each field
 * CanGraduate is true if and only if gpa is greater than or equal to 2 and class is 12
 * class defaults to 9
 * age defaults to 13
 * happiness defaults to 5
 * 
 * Create a method failClass(String subject) that will reduce gpa by 0.5 and if subject == favoriteSubject, reduce happiness by 1
 * Create a method playGamesDuringClass() that will reduce gpa by 0.2 and increase happiness by 0.1
 * Create a method doHomework() that will increase gpa by 0.1 and reduce happiness by 0.2
 * Create a method age() that will increase age and class by 1, and reduce happiness by 0.1
 * 
 * Create any other methods you feel appropriate to this class.
